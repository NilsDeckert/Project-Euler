# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, (1^2)+(2^2)+...+(10^2) = 385
#
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1+2+...+10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
#
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640
#
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
